                <ul>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1906</strong> - June 3rd, <strong>Josephine Baker</strong> (born <strong>Freda Josephine McDonald</strong>) born in St. Louis Missouri</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1917</strong> - A terrified Josephine McDonald witnessed racial violence in
                         East St. Louis. In a speech years later, she recalled what she had seen:
                    <span><em>"I can still see myself standing on the west bank of the Mississippi looking over into East St. Louis and 
                        watching the glow of the burning of Negro homes lighting the sky. We children stood huddled together in 
                        bewilderment ... frightened to death with the screams of the Negro families running across this bridge with
                         nothing but what they had on their backs as their worldly belongings... So with this vision I ran and ran 
                         and ran...."</em></span></li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1918</strong> - Dropped out of school</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1919</strong> - Worked as a waitress at the Old Chauffeur's Club. She also lived as a street child in
                         the slums of St. Louis, sleeping in cardboard shelters, scavenging for food in garbage cans, making a living
                          with street-corner dancing. It was at the Old Chauffeur's Club where Josephine met Willie Wells, and 
                          subsequently married him at age 13; however, the marriage lasted less than a year. Following her divorce from
                           Wells, she found work with a street performance group called the Jones Family Band</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1921</strong> - At the age of 15 she married Howard Baker</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1925</strong> - She left him when her vaudeville troupe was booked into a New York City venue, and 
                        divorced in 1925; it was during this time she began to see significant career success, and she continued to
                         use his last name professionally for the rest of her life</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1925</strong> - At the age of 19 Baker sailed to Paris, and opened on 2 October in 
                        <em>la Revue nègre</em> at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1926</strong> - In Paris, she became an instant success for her erotic dancing, and for appearing 
                        practically nude onstage. After a successful tour of Europe, she broke her contract and returned to France
                         to star at the Folies Bergère, setting the standard for her future acts</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1927</strong> - Starred in the silent film <span>

                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1929</strong> - Baker became the first African-American star to visit Yugoslavia, while on tour in 
                        Central Europe via the Orient Express. In Belgrade, she performed at Luxor Balkanska, the most luxurious 
                        venue in the city at the time. She included Pirot kilim into her routine, as a nod to the local culture,
                         and she donated some of the show's proceeds to poor children of Serbia. In Zagreb, she was received by 
                         adoring fans at the train station. However, some of her shows were cancelled, due to opposition from 
                         the local clergy and morality police</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1931</strong> - Josephine released her most successful song, <strong>"J'ai deux amours"</strong>
                         The song expresses the sentiment that "I have two loves, my country and Paris."</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1934</strong> - Starred in the film <span>
                        <a id="tribute-list-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouzou_(film)" target="_blank"><em>Zouzou</em></a></span>, and she also took the lead in a revival of Jacques
                         Offenbach's opera <em>La créole</em>, which premiered in December of that year for a six-month run at the Théâtre Marigny on the 
                         Champs-Élysées of Paris </li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1935</strong> - Starred in the film <span><a id="tribute-list-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Tam_Tam" target="_blank"><em>
                        Princesse Tam Tam</em></a></span></li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1937</strong> - After an unsuccessful stint in America, Baker returned to Paris in 1937, married the French industrialist
                         Jean Lion, and became a French citizen.</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1939</strong> - In September 1939, when France declared war on Germany in response to the invasion of Poland, Baker was 
                        recruited by the Deuxième Bureau, the French military intelligence agency, as an "honorable correspondent". Baker worked with 
                        Jacques Abtey, the head of French counterintelligence in Paris. She socialised with the Germans at embassies, ministries, night
                         clubs, charming them while secretly gathering information. Her café-society fame enabled her to rub shoulders with those in the
                          know, from high-ranking Japanese officials to Italian and Vichy bureaucrats, reporting to Abtey what she heard. She attended
                           parties and gathered information at the Italian embassy without raising suspicion.
                        <p>
                            When the Germans invaded France, Baker left Paris and went to the Château des Milandes, her home in the Dordogne département
                             in the south of France. She housed people who were eager to help the Free French effort led by Charles de Gaulle and supplied
                              them with visas. As an entertainer, Baker had an excuse for moving around Europe, visiting neutral nations such as Portugal,
                               as well as some in South America. She carried information for transmission to England, about airfields, harbors, and German
                                troop concentrations in the West of France. Notes were written in invisible ink on Baker's sheet music. As written in Jazz
                                 Age Cleopatra, "She specialized in gatherings at embassies and ministries, charming people as she had always done, but at
                                  the same time trying to remember interesting items to transmit."
                        </p></li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1940</strong> - Starred in the film <em>Fausse Alerte</em></li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1941</strong> - Josephine Baker and her entourage went to the French colonies in North Africa. The stated reason was Baker's health (since
                         she was recovering from another case of pneumonia) but the real reason was to continue helping the Resistance. From a base in Morocco,
                          she made tours of Spain. She pinned notes with the information she gathered inside her underwear (counting on her celebrity to avoid
                           a strip search). She met the Pasha of Marrakech, whose support helped her through a miscarriage (the last of several). After the 
                           miscarriage, she developed an infection so severe it required a hysterectomy. The infection spread and she developed peritonitis 
                           and then sepsis. After her recovery (which she continued to fall in and out of), she started touring to entertain British, French,
                            and American soldiers in North Africa. The Free French had no organized entertainment network for their troops, so Baker and her
                             entourage managed for the most part on their own. They allowed no civilians and charged no admission.
                            <p>After the war, Baker was awarded the Resistance Medal by the French Committee of National Liberation, the Croix de Guerre by the
                                 French military, and was named a Chevalier of the <em>Légion d'honneur</em> by General Charles de Gaulle</p></li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1949</strong> - a reinvented Baker returned in triumph to the Folies Bergère. Bolstered by recognition of her wartime heroism,
                         Baker the performer assumed a new gravitas, unafraid to take on serious music or subject matter. The engagement was a rousing success
                          and reestablished Baker as one of Paris' pre-eminent entertainers</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1951</strong> - Baker was invited back to the United States for a nightclub engagement in Miami. After winning a public battle
                         over desegregating the club's audience, Baker followed up her sold-out run at the club with a national tour. Rave reviews and 
                         enthusiastic audiences accompanied her everywhere, climaxed by a parade in Harlem in honor of her new title: NAACP's "Woman of the Year".
                          Her reputation as a crusader grew to such an extent that the NAACP had <strong>Sunday 20 May 1951 declared "Josephine Baker Day"</strong>
                        <p>Although based in France, Baker supported the Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s</p>
                         <p>
                            An incident at the Stork Club in October 1951 interrupted and overturned her plans. Baker criticized the club's unwritten policy of 
                            discouraging Black patrons, then scolded columnist Walter Winchell, an old ally, for not rising to her defense. Winchell responded 
                            swiftly with a series of harsh public rebukes, including accusations of Communist sympathies (a serious charge at the time). The 
                            ensuing publicity resulted in the termination of Baker's work visa, forcing her to cancel all her engagements and return to France.
                             It was almost a decade before U.S. officials allowed her back into the country 
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        Actress Grace Kelly, who was at the club at the time, rushed over to Baker, took her by the arm and stormed out with her entire party,
                         vowing never to return (although she returned on 3 January 1956 with Prince Rainier of Monaco). The two women became close friends after the incident.
                    </p></li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1952</strong> - Baker was hired to crown the Queen of the Cavalcade of Jazz for the famed eighth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley
                         Field in Los Angeles, which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on 1 June. Also featured to perform that day were Roy Brown and His Mighty Men, 
                         Anna Mae Winburn and Her Sweethearts, Toni Harper, Louis Jordan, Jimmy Witherspoon and Jerry Wallace.</li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1963</strong> - she spoke at the March on Washington at the side of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Baker was the only official female speaker.
                         While wearing her Free French uniform emblazoned with her medal of the Légion d'honneur, she introduced the "Negro Women for Civil Rights". Rosa
                          Parks and Daisy Bates were among those she acknowledged, and both gave brief speeches. Not everyone involved wanted Baker present at the March;
                           some thought her time overseas had made her a woman of France, one who was disconnected from the Civil Rights issues going on in America. In her
                            speech, one of the things Baker said:
                        <span id="tribute-quote"><p>
                            "I have walked into the palaces of kings and queens and into the houses of presidents. And much more. But I could not walk into a hotel in America
                             and get a cup of coffee, and that made me mad. And when I get mad, you know that I open my big mouth. And then look out, 'cause when Josephine
                              opens her mouth, they hear it all over the world ..."
                        </p></span>
                    <p>After King's assassination, his widow Coretta Scott King approached Baker in the Netherlands to ask if she would take her husband's place as leader 
                        of the Civil Rights Movement. After many days of thinking it over, Baker declined, saying her children were "too young to lose their mother".</p></li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>1975</strong> - Four days later Baker was found lying peacefully in her bed surrounded by newspapers with glowing reviews of her performance.
                         She was in a coma after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. She was taken to Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, where she died, aged 68, on 12 April 1975.
                        <p>
                            Baker received a full Catholic funeral at L'Église de la Madeleine, attracting more than 20,000 mourners. The only American-born woman to receive
                             full French military honors at her funeral, Baker's funeral was the occasion of a huge procession. After a family service at Saint-Charles Church
                              in Monte Carlo, Baker was interred at Monaco's Cimetière de Monaco.
                        </p></li>
                    <li id="tribute-list-item"><strong>2021</strong> - Baker's remains reburied at the Panthéon in November 2021
                    <p>
                        The ceremony took place on Tuesday 30 November 2021, and Baker thus became the first black woman to be honored in the secular temple to the "great men"
                         of the French Republic
